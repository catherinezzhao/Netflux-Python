# Netflux

Netflux is a user-friendly software for developing dynamic computational models of biological networks. Models are created in Excel format and then simulated using the Netflux graphical interface. No computer programming is required. 

**This version of Netflux was created in Dec 2021. For the original MATLAB version of Netflux and its more information on installation and documentation, visit https://github.com/saucermanlab/Netflux/.**

Netflux can export network structures and simulation results for visualization in Cytoscape or other software packages. Netflux can also export MATLAB or Python code for more advanced network simulations. Netflux can import network structures based on SIF or SBML-QUAL formats.

Netflux simulates networks using a modeling approach called logic-based differential equations. These methods are described in detail here:

Netflux has been used to develop large-scale computational models of signaling networks for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibroblasts, and mechano-signaling. Netflux has also been used in educational settings from high school (simulations of social networks) through graduate school levels.
